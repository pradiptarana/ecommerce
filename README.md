# ecommerce

This is a ecoomerce service contains api gw, user, order and warehouse service.

I try to divide the function into microservices.

## How To Run
- For each service, you should copy the sample env to .env file.
- Run `docker-compose build` to build all the containers.
- Run `docker-compose up` to run all the containers.
- Run `docker ps` to check the running containers.
- Access the api gateway at localhost:8080
- Run `docker compose down` to stop all the services.
